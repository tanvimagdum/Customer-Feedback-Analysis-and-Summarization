# Customer-Feedback-Analysis-and-Summarization

Customer feedback is an invaluable resource for businesses, offering information that can help improve products, services, and the overall customer experience. In today’s fast-paced and competitive market, understanding what customers feel and say about your offerings is crucial. This project, Customer Feedback Analysis and Summarization, aims to harness the power of data to discover trends in consumer reviews.
Using PySpark and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we’ll analyze large-scale Amazon product reviews to efficiently handle and process vast amounts of text data, apply NLP tools to clean, analyze, and extract sentiments from customer feedback, identify recurring themes and summarize reviews to reveal actionable insights.
By focusing on real-world applications, this project demonstrates how businesses can utilise technology to gain deeper knowledge into customer sentiment and identify common issues or highlights that matter most to consumers.
